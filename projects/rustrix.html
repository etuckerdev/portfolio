          <h2>Learning Motivation</h2>
          <p>Coming from a background in C# and enterprise systems, I wanted to explore how Rust's memory safety guarantees and performance characteristics could apply to systems programming challenges, particularly in AI-adjacent domains where performance and reliability are critical.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Technical Exploration Areas</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Memory-safe systems programming patterns that eliminate entire classes of bugs common in traditional systems languages.</li>
            <li>Performance optimization techniques leveraging Rust's zero-cost abstractions for high-throughput data processing.</li>
            <li>Concurrent programming models using Rust's ownership system to prevent data races and ensure thread safety.</li>
            <li>Integration patterns for AI/ML workflows that maintain system reliability while supporting experimental development.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Systems Architecture Focus</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Exploring Rust's ownership model as an alternative to manual memory management and garbage collection.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Critical Paths:</strong> Implementing algorithms where zero-cost abstractions provide measurable performance benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Leveraging Rust's Result type system for robust error propagation in systems contexts.</li>
            <li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Building bridges between Rust systems components and other language ecosystems.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Key Learning Outcomes</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Deep understanding of ownership, borrowing, and lifetime concepts as applied to real-world systems challenges.</li>
            <li>Practical experience with Rust's type system for encoding invariants and preventing runtime errors.</li>
            <li>Performance optimization strategies unique to Rust's compilation model and memory layout guarantees.</li>
            <li>Appreciation for how modern systems languages can improve reliability without sacrificing performance.</li>
          </ul>
