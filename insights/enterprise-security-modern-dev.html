          <h2>Beyond Traditional Security Models</h2>
          <p>Financial services at Stax Inc. required security architectures that could reason across multiple threat dimensions simultaneously. Traditional perimeter-based security and linear incident response workflows couldn't adapt to sophisticated attack patterns that evolved faster than human analysis could track.</p>
          
          <p>This drove development of a quantum-inspired security intelligence system based on manifold reasoning—treating security events as nodes in hyperbolic conceptual spaces, enabling real-time detection of attack patterns invisible to conventional SIEM approaches.</p>

          <h3>Quantum-Inspired Detection Architecture</h3>
          <p>The core innovation involved representing security events as points on non-Euclidean manifolds, where threat relationships emerged through topological proximity rather than static rule matching:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hyperbolic threat spaces</strong>: Attack vectors mapped to hyperbolic manifolds for exponential relationship modeling</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-path reasoning</strong>: 361 parallel analysis branches exploring different threat trajectories</li>
            <li><strong>Semantic coherence validation</strong>: Continuous verification of threat model consistency across manifold regions</li>
            <li><strong>Learning-based adaptation</strong>: Node weights adjusted based on successful threat mitigation outcomes</li>
